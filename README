Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Input: root = []
Output: true

1. Check if subtrees have height with a distance of 1, between one another
2. If they do, check if the subtrees are balanced
